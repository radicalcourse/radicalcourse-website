		<p>
		The addiction to thinking is the main problem of the modern civilization. People are constantly dwelling on the past or 
		worrying about the future. This habit of endless thinking creates unnecessary suffering and decreases the quality of life. 
		It is the root cause of most of the problems.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. 
		As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people’s thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional 
		and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy.
		<br>
		– Eckhart Tolle
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
		The solution to this problem is Mindfulness - the idea of living in the present moment. It is the foundation of life because you are 
		always here and now. Mindfulness is widely accepted and supported by philosophers, psychologists,  spiritual gurus and scientists, but it is 
		not yet present in our mainstream society.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, nor to worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly.
		<br>
		– Buddha
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
		If you do not know what this is all about, then start reading Eckhart Tolle&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Now-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333706480&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">&#8220;The Power of Now&#8221;</a> - a clearly written introduction to mindfulness.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		Although originally articulated as a part of what we know in the West as Buddhism, there is nothing inherently religious 
		about mindfulness, and it is often taught independent of religious or cultural connotation.
		<br>
		– Jon Kabat-Zinn

		<div style="visibility:hidden;height:1em;">&nbsp;</div>
		
		<p>
		This is the symbol for the idea of being here and now, which is also called mindfulness or present moment awareness. 
		The symbol was designed by a graphic designer from Lithuania during a period of two years.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		When you see this symbol, anywhere - in public, personal or virtual spaces - it will work as a reminder for you to become aware of this present moment.
		</p>

		<p>
		Firstly, this symbol is presented like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#/media/File:World_line.svg" target="_blank">physical 
		representation</a> of the present moment.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Vertical forms represent time - past and future. Horizontal forms represent space  - 360 degrees. And the one is always in the center - being 
		here and now - perfect equanimity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Secondly, you can see a symbol of a water drop. This is the <a href="img/mindfulness-metaphor.jpg" target="_blank">most 
		often used metaphor</a> to represent the idea of mindfulness. But here, the water drop is presented in a kind of mirrored way which symbolizes time - past 
		and future, both are illusions, so stay centered in the present.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		Empty your mind, be formless. shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes 
		the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend. 
		<br>
		– Bruce Lee
