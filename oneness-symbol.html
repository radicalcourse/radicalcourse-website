		Everything is interconnected, all is one with the Universe. This idea is the ancient wisdom that is now proven by the modern science.
		</p>

		<p>
		Naturally, you have learned to see things as separate. But in fact, all things are closely interconnected. 
		Even the particles on a subatomic level interchange between you and another human being, between you and a tree, a rock, and all other surroundings. 
		The skin and the boundaries are just optical illusions.
		</p>

		<blockquote>
		You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.
		<br>
		-- Alan Wilson Watts
		</blockquote>

		<p>
		The interconnections are not only physical but also psychological. If you take a good look at your mind, you will see that it consists of influences 
		from your parents, friends, teachers, culture. Any idea you have can be traced to the root cause of it, to the point where it first appeared in your mind.
		You can follow it further and see what outside influences created this idea, and then follow the influences back in time to past generations.
		</p>

		<p>
		We are all part of one inseparable web of relationships. The Earth itself is also a part of an organism we call the Universe.

		<img src="img/one-with-the-universe-earth-planet-cosmos-symbol.png" alt="Oneness, one with the Universe, Earth, Planet, Cosmos, interconnectedness symbol" width="518" height="307" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-284">
		<div style="visibility:hidden;height:1em;">&nbsp;</div>
		<p>
		The symbol for Oneness is presented like a metaphor of us and the Earth. It is a big organism and we, people, are parts of this organism. The Earth is also a part of an even bigger organism. It is like a tree with the roots that extend to the vast cosmos. Everything is interconnected.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		All organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth are closely integrated to form a single and self-regulating complex system, maintaining the conditions for life on the planet.
		<br>
		– Gaia Hypothesis
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
		Oneness is the foundational truth because it is based on the reality itself. All other ideas about life and moral behaviors should be based on the idea of Oneness. 
		Unfortunately, this is not the case in our culture. That is why we see wars, inequality, the destruction of Earth, unnecessary suffering and other problems.
		</p>

		<p>
		This symbol is the invitation to see and accept the true reality, and then live our lives according to it.
		</p>

		<blockquote>
		A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts 
		and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, 
		restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this 
		prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.
		<br>
		-- Albert Einstein
